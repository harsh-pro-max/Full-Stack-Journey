    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>Gulshan Arora, a once-promising but now disillusioned basketball coach, career takes an unexpected turn when he is assigned to train a team of intellectually challenged basketball players. Initially, Gulshan finds the task incredibly challenging, struggling to connect with his new team due to their unique conditions and individual needs. His patience is frequently tested, and he often feels overwhelmed by the responsibility.

As Gulshan grudgingly begins working with the team, he slowly starts to understand their individual struggles and strengths. A significant turning point in his coaching approach comes when he helps Guddu, one of the players, overcome his debilitating fear of bathing, a phobia that has caused significant distress. This small victory marks the beginning of a deeper bond between Gulshan and his team. During this period, the team gains a new, charismatic member, Golu Khan, whose infectious enthusiasm further brightens the group's spirits and dynamic.</p>
