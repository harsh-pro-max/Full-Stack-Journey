# Python Assignments: Object-Oriented Programming (Advanced)

# 1. Write a Python script to create a Profile class with 3 attributes (name, email, age).

# 2. Write a Python script to update the above Profile class with encapsulation.

# 3. Write a Python script to update Question 2, changing email and age to private attributes (__email and __age).

# 4. Write a Python script to update Question 2, add a class variable (platform) and create a classmethod to access it.

# 5. Write a Python script to create a Calculator class with 2 methods for adding and subtracting 2 values.

# 6. Write a Python script to create a Calculator 2.0 class with 2 methods for multiplication 
#    and division of 2 values and inherit it from the Calculator class.

# 7. Write a Python script to create a Phone class with 2 methods to print the features (calling and SMS).

# 8. Write a Python script to create a SmartPhone class by inheriting Calculator 2.0 and Phone Class.

# 9. Write a Python script to create an application like Truecaller where names and numbers are stored. 
#    The Truecaller class will have 2 methods (1st to fetch the name of a number and 2nd to add a new entry).

# 10. Write a Python script to add a new method in the SmartPhone class which accepts a Truecaller object 
#     as a parameter and calls the fetch method of Truecaller.
