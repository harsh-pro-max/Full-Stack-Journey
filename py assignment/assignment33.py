# Python Assignments: Iterators, Generators, and Decorators


# 1. Use iter and next method to access all the elements of a given set using while loop.


# 2. Create a generator to produce first n odd natural numbers.

# 3. Create a generator to produce first n even natural numbers.

# 4. Create a generator to produce squares of first N natural numbers.

# 5. Create a generator to produce first n terms of the Fibonacci series.

# 6. Create a generator to produce first n prime numbers.

# 7. Create an endless iterator using a generator method to produce terms of the Fibonacci series.

# 8. Create an endless iterator using a generator method to produce prime numbers.

# 9. Define a function which takes lengths of three sides of a triangle as arguments and 
#    displays the perimeter of the triangle. Apply a decorator to check for validity.

# 10. Define a function which calculates HCF of two numbers. Apply a decorator to check 
#     whether the given numbers are co-prime or not.
